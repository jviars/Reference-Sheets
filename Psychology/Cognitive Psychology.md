# Cognitive Psychology Cheat Sheet

## Attention

### Types of Attention
1. Selective Attention
   - Focus on specific stimuli while ignoring others
   - Example: Cocktail party effect (Cherry, 1953)
   - Theories: Broadbent's filter theory, Treisman's attenuation theory

2. Divided Attention
   - Processing multiple stimuli simultaneously
   - Limited by cognitive resources
   - Affected by task difficulty and practice

3. Sustained Attention
   - Maintaining focus over extended periods
   - Vigilance decrement over time
   - Influenced by arousal and motivation

### Factors Affecting Attention
- Bottom-up processing (stimulus-driven)
- Top-down processing (goal-directed)
- Signal detection theory
- Change blindness
- Inattentional blindness
